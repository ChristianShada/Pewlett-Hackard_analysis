# Pewlett-Hackard_analysis
### _Overview of the Analysis_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this data analysys, we are taking employees at Pwelett_Hackard, and finding them through different queries. Through title type, age, and date to which they had been hired. This makes them eligable for either the retirement package, or the mentorship program. Through this, I was able to take the different tables provided. Combine them through a commonality, mostly through the employee number, and join different csv files to create more useful data to make better/faster decisions.<br>

### _Results_
- After finding the wanted year, hire-date and title, along with employee number, I went ahead and factored in the experience by month. This will give you a great starting point to where you would want to start your search for candidates for the mentorship program. Please see the chart to begin your search.<br>

- You may want to consider looking at the data through a different lense. There are lots of opportuntiies within this list. I have compiled a list based on departments and how many candidates are in each department, based on the criteria provided. <br>

- When you are thinking about those who you will want to partake in the mentorship program, consider those whom are nearing retirement age and if they will want to continue on as a mentor, or if they will want to retire. It is important to compare the retirement_info table to that of the mentorship_elegibiltiy. I went ahead and created a top 10 based on experiences of years and age as one consiers life experience as well for a mentorship program.<br>

- What our data has also told us is that there are a lot of positions that will need to be filled as people begin to retire and job opportuties start to open up. We can see this in our table of Retireing Titles.

### _Summary_ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As companies get older, there will be more and more baby-boomers who have been at these physical jobs. Jobs to which people would need to replace, or create a more dynamic job to which can be filled by those working remotely, or a more attractive job than the initial "nine-to-five". As previously stated, it will be important to look at both the employes looking to retires and pit them against people who are ready to retire, but still want to participate in a mentorship program. The charts provided above gives you good insight of who to talk to in order to begin the process. Luckily there are enough employees to which can fill the next generation at Pewlett Hackard, however it is important to act sooner than later, before opportunities come up for those clost to retirement and it is too late to make a coodinated attack to fill those positions that are being vacated.<br>
